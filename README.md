# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

By the end, they’ll have a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## 🚩 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
- ✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## 🗂️ Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

**Goal:** Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.

- **Data Sources:**

  - Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV & API)
  - Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository

  👉 Recommended for beginners: Use the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (easy to load with pandas).

- **Action:** Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from the above link and save it in your working folder.

### 2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration

**Goal:** Load the dataset and explore its structure.

- **Tasks:**

  - Load data using `pandas.read_csv()`.
  - Check columns: `df.columns`.
  - Preview rows: `df.head()`.
  - Identify missing values: `df.isnull().sum()`.

- **Tools:** pandas

- **Key columns:** date, location, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, new_deaths, total_vaccinations, etc.

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

**Goal:** Prepare data for analysis.

- **Tasks:**

  - Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
  - Drop rows with missing dates/critical values.
  - Convert date column to datetime: `pd.to_datetime()`.
  - Handle missing numeric values with `fillna()` or `interpolate()`.

- **Tools:** pandas

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Goal:** Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.

- **Tasks:**

  - Plot total cases over time for selected countries.
  - Plot total deaths over time.
  - Compare daily new cases between countries.
  - Calculate the death rate: `total_deaths / total_cases`.

- **Visualizations:**

  - Line charts (cases & deaths over time).
  - Bar charts (top countries by total cases).
  - Heatmaps (optional for correlation analysis).

- **Tools:** matplotlib, seaborn

### 5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress

**Goal:** Analyze vaccination rollouts.

- **Tasks:**

  - Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.
  - Compare % vaccinated population.

- **Charts:** Line charts, optional pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.

- **Tools:** matplotlib, seaborn

### 6️⃣ Optional: Build a Choropleth Map

**Goal:** Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.

- **Tools:** Plotly Express or geopandas (advanced)

- **Tasks:**
  - Prepare a dataframe with `iso_code`, `total_cases` for the latest date.
  - Plot a choropleth showing case density or vaccination rates.

### 7️⃣ Insights & Reporting

**Goal:** Summarize findings.

- **Tasks:**

  - Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").
  - Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.
  - Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write your narrative.

- **Deliverables:** A well-documented Jupyter Notebook combining:
  - Code
  - Visualizations
  - Narrative explanations
  - Optional export: Notebook → PDF or a PowerPoint with screenshots.

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools

- ✅ Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- ✅ pandas
- ✅ matplotlib & seaborn
- ✅ Optional: plotly, geopandas

## 🎯 Optional Stretch Goals

- ⭐ Allow user input (choose country & date range)
- ⭐ Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash
- ⭐ Include hospitalization or ICU data if available

## ✅ Final Deliverable

A Jupyter Notebook data report that:

- Loads, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes COVID-19 data.
- Communicates insights with a clear narrative and visuals.
- Is easy to read, well-commented, and reproducible.
